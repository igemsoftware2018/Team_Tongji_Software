  * Python >= 3.5
  * Django >= 2.0
  * RDKit: a collection of cheminformatics software
  * cobra: a tool used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes

## How to use Alpha Ant?
  **We strongly recommend to use our [web tool](http://118.31.56.237:8099/Alpha%20ant/), which can search with high-speed**
  
  Still, you can download our tool and use locally by Django after satisfying the requerements. 
  
  * download
   `git clone https://github.com/igemsoftware2018/Team_Tongji_Software.git`
  * run python
